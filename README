gettext-js
======


About
------

gettext-js is an implementation of the gettext API in JavaScript, with
adaptions to the characteristics of JavaScript. These adaptions arise from the
asynchronous characteristics of the language, and the fact that it is used in
non latency-free server/client-environments.


Status
------

Development has just started, and the code is far from beeing complete. The
existing code only covers the parsing of PO files, and their serialization to
JSON format.


Adaptions
------

Since JavaScript programs usually make use of asynchronous programming,
gettext-js does not support setting a global state of the gettext module.

When binding a textdomain, an object with a defined state is returned, that may
listen to language change events occurring higher in the hierarchy, but never
changes the domain it has been bound to initially.

For browser-based JavaScript, gettext-js offers the possibility to execute a
callback upon catalog/domain load for code that depends on it.

Other adaptions will include lazy evaluation and the possibility to translate
DOM nodes (elements and text).
